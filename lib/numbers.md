# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

Fixnum for integers and Float for decimal numbers.

# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

+, -, *, /, ** and % for addition, substraction, multiplication, division, exponential multiplication and modular division.

# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

The '+' operator produces the sum of two number, or concatenates two strings.

# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

It will not work unless you convert it to another data type.  "20".to_i will convert the string to an integer.

# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

'times' is a function that will run a block of code a number of times specificed by the integer.
